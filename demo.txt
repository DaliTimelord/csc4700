What is your favorite movie?
Vanilla Sky
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
I would go to Japan, so I can eat lots of sushi, visit the shrines, and 
go to the bath houses!
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
The ability to control time. The reason why I'd want this kind of 
power is that it always seems like there isn't enough time to do anything!
